### Response:
Step 1: We have seven vehicles with the following ages based on the given information: a sedan, a truck, a bus, a station wagon, a tractor, a convertible, and a limousine. So we need to determine their positions based on age.\n\n
Step 2: The truck is mentioned as the oldest vehicle. So we place the truck in position 1 (the oldest).\n\n
Step 3: The tractor is described as the newest vehicle. So we place the tractor in position 7 (the newest).\n\n
Step 4: The station wagon is stated to be the third-newest. So we place the station wagon in position 5.\n\n
Step 5: The sedan is older than the station wagon.So the sedan must occupy a position before position 5, the sedan must be in position 4.\n\n
Step 6: The bus is older than the convertible. So, to find their positions, we note that the convertible has to be in a newer position than the bus. Since we already have the truck in position 1, the sedan in position 4, and the station wagon in position 5, the only available positions left for the bus and convertible are positions 2 and 3.\n\n
Step 7: Since the bus is older than the convertible.So we place the bus in position 2 and the convertible in position 3.\n\n
Step 8: Now we summarize the positions: Truck (1), Bus (2), Convertible (3), Sedan (4), Station Wagon (5), Limousine (6), and Tractor (7). \n\n
Step 9: Based on this arrangement, the sedan is in position 4. So this leads us to conclude that it is the fourth-newest vehicle.\n\nFinal Answer: The answer is (A).",
